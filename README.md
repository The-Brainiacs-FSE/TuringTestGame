# Turing Test Game
This is the Turing Test Game Repository by the team **"The Brainiacs"** that will allow users to play games.

## Project Description
The project is an interactive Turing test game for player and game admin. The target players of the game are visitors in outreach events. A set of sentences, including one in the original language and several translations of different quality, is shown to the player. The player is challenged to identify the human translation from the set. All the Machine Traslation is from the National Research Council of Canada’s (NRC) Multilingual Text Processing team.

## Project Roadmap

* Jira project to track and document user stories/features and sprints [link](https://siyangzhang.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/TTG/boards/2).
* Bi-weekly team meeting with Daniel on every Tuesday, 4pm
* Bi-weekly team meeting with Jackie on every Monday, 11:30am, also keep updated with Slack.

## Milestones
Here are the milestones that we would be reaching:

### Milestone 1: Admin Panel Development
A game admin panel is used by NRC staff to start the game by choosing the game parameters, such as the set of sentence tuples, number of tuples drawn from the set in each game, etc.

**Task:**
1. Implement UI to start the game, allow admin to draw sentence tuple from sentence sets. 
2. Next button to next page.

### Milestone 2: Game Development
**Game flow in this milestone:**
1. Display a sentence tuple: the original sentence, human reference translation and three candidate translations.
2. Allow the player to select potential robot translations and cancel selection. Allow the player to confirm decision.
3. Display robot judge (YiSi)’s decision. Move on to the next step when player is ready. (e.g. pressing the next button; but open for other implementations)
4. Display true identity of translators (human/SMT/NMT). Move on to the next step when player is ready. (e.g. pressing the next button; but open for other implementations)
5. Display player vs. robot judge scores. Move on to the next step when player is ready. (e.g. pressing the next button; but open for other implementations)
6. Go to step 1 with a new sentence tuple. Game ends when the loaded sets of sentences are exhausted or the game admin chooses to end it.

**Task:**
1. Display sentence tuple along with user selection section
2. Display robot judge decision
3. Display true identities
4. Display comparison results, allowing start a new game or log the results

### Milestone 3: Data Log and Output
Log user decisions in the game play.(question)
When game ends, allow game admin to save the player log for further analysis.

## User Stories

### Game Admin
* Starts the game by specifying parameters.
* Collects player logs when game is complete for further analysis.

### Player
* Choose on whether one translation is generated by robot or not, mark/unmark the decision and click next button to check the robot’s idea.
* View actual results, compare player decision with the robot’s.
* Choose to start a new round of game.

## Future Work
*Details to be added later*

## Available options to run the game locally

* Provide two options for local run within offline environment 

* One option is to pull docker image locally and run within container 

* The other is to clone whole repository locally, use NPM to install packages and dependencies then run locally

### NPM:

* Clone the repository to local
* within command line console, run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` to install necessary packages and solve depencency issue
* run `npm start` to start the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
* run `npm test` to check the test suits.

### Docker: 
* Already built the application locally and push the created image to remote docker hub.
* First pull the docker image to local then run the application within container, mapped to localhost
* Instructions to run application locally with docker:
* [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
* pull [remote docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/alexyoungz/turingtestgame/tags) with following command:
* `docker pull alexyoungz/turingtestgame:turingtestgame`
* start docker image within container with following command(mapped to port 3000 by default):  
* `docker run -p 3000:3000 -it turingtestgame`
